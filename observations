Hypotheses regarding s01 - s09 

//this is taking the derivative of the graph
0 to n (one key): insert / find 
s01: constant / c 
s02: linear / c
s03: constant / c
s04: constant / c
s05: constant / c 
s06: constant / c
s07: constant /c 


s03 — u r so slow

test2: find and insert with key = i, i to n (can’t take derivative — described as seen) 
s01: two distinct constant lines — perhaps hash
s02: constant (near 0) and suddenly linear around 100 000
s03: hash table??? 
s04: exponential
s05: exponential and then linear
s06: linear and then log n
s07: broken off linear ones
